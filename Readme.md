In many application measured data appears nonlinear, i.e. restricted in a certain range or equipped with a different distance measure.

This toolbox provides an easy access to image processing tasks for such data,
where the values of each measurement are points on a manifold.
You can get started by downloading the
[source code from Github](https://github.com/kellertuer/MVIRT/archive/master.zip)
or by cloning the [git-repository](https://github.com/kellertuer/MVIRT) using

````
    git clone git@github.com:kellertuer/MVIRT.git
````

Examples are
[InSAR imaging](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_Synthetic_Aperture_Radar)
or when working with phase data, i.e. on the circle ùïä¬π or [Diffusion Tensor Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI) (DTI), where
every data items are an n ‚®â n symmetric positive definite matrices, ùí´(n).
